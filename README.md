# TetrisGo
A Tetris-based exercise game using real-life poses to play a game of Tetris. You can play it right now in the browser here:

[https://dostee-hemin.github.io/TetrisGo/](https://dostee-hemin.github.io/TetrisGo/).

You will need to provide access to your webcam when the program asks for it to play the game. On the main menu, when you first hit ENTER, the program will load the pose detection model, which could take some time. Please be patient.
